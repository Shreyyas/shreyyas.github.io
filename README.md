## [TwitterTicker](https://github.com/Shreyyas/TwitterTicker/tree/FinalVis)

You can view my Twitter-Based visualization system directly from this site! This system allows you to analyze the effect of a company's tweets on that company's stock price. 

### Notes on using TwitterTicker:

1)  Select at least one company.<br>
2)  Select either <b>Magnet View</b> or <b>Cluster View</b>.<br>
3)  In <b>Magnet View</b>, select a magnet, and drag & drop it in the center. Double click it and see the effect! Keywords that are closer are more attracted (have more significance / value) towards that attribute.<br>
4)  In <b>Cluster View</b>, you can see the keywords with the highest popularity. Bubble size corresponds to that keyword's popularity. <br>
5)  In either view, hovering over a bubble will display further details. You can use the date in the view to see any trends/correlations associated with that keyword on the stock price by zooming into the <b>Stock Timeline Graph</b> towards that date. <br>
